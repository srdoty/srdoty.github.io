### Comments

1. (Reporting an inaccuracy.) Starting in 2001, many papers giving
   presentations of Schur algeras, $q$-Schur algebras, and generalized
   Schur (and $q$-Schur) algebras were published, by myself with
   Giaquinto, myself, Du and Parshall, and a number of others. In all
   of those papers, the ($q$)-Serre relations were imposed on the
   generators of of the plus and minus parts of the (quantized)
   enveloping algebra. However, as pointed out by R. Rouquier, the
   ($q$)-Serre relations are *consequences* of the other defining
   relations, and thus can be omitted from the presentations in all of
   those papers. Details and a proof can be found in the paper (with
   Anthony Giaquinto): [*Cellular bases of generalised $q$-Schur
   algebras,* Math. Proc. Camb. Philos. Soc. 162, 533--560 (2017)].

   
### Errata

1. (with J. Matthew Douglass) *Schur--Weyl duality and the free Lie
   algebra.* Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 145, 3263--3277 (2017).

   Corollary 2.4 is incorrect. See Remark 6.1 in [S. Donkin, 
   J. Algebra 526 (2018)].


1. (with David J. Benson) *Schur--Weyl duality over finite fields.*
   Arch.  Math. 93, 425--435 (2009).

   The proof of Lemma 4.1 has a minor mistake, but the result is
   correct. See the proof of Lemma 3.2 in [T. Cruz, Commun. in Algebra
   47 (2019)] for a correct argument.


1. (with Richard Dipper) *The rational Schur algebra.*
   Represent. Theory. 12, 58--83 (2008).

   There are several mistakes in this paper. See [S. Donkin,
   J. Algebra 405 (2014)] for corrections.


1. (with Anthony Giaquinto) *Presenting Schur algebras.*
   Internat. Math. Res.  Notices. 2002, 1907 (2002).

   There is a small mistake in the statement of Theorems 2.3 and 3.3.
   The definitions of $Y_-$ in equations (2.7) and (3.9) are incorrect
   as stated. In those sets one should replace the content $\chi$ by a
   different content function $\chi'$ which is defined so that
   $\chi'(x_\alpha) = \varepsilon_{\text{min}(i,j)}$ if $\alpha =
   \varepsilon_i - \varepsilon_j$.

1. (with Karin Erdmann, Stuart Martin, and Daniel K. Nakano)
   *Representation type of Schur algebras.* Math Z. 232, 137--182 (1999).

   The Schur algebra $S(2,11)$ for $p = 2$ is tame. Theorems (A) and (B)
   in Section 1.2 should be corrected accordingly. The mistake comes
   from the first sentence in 3.5, which is incorrect. (Thanks to Qi
   Wang for pointing out the error.)
