1. (with J. Matthew Douglass) *Schur--Weyl duality and the free Lie
   algebra.* Proc. Amer. Math. Soc. 145, 3263--3277 (2017).

   Corollary 2.4 is incorrect. See Remark 6.1 in [S. Donkin, 
   J. Algebra 526 (2018)].


1. (with Anthony Giaquinto) *Cellular bases of generalised $q$-Schur
   algebras.* Math. Proc. Camb. Philos. Soc. 162, 533--560 (2017).

   This paper proves that the $q$-Serre relations are automatically
   satisfied in (generalized) $q$-Schur algebras. This is also true when
   $q = 1$ (the classical case). Thus, imposing those relations in the
   earlier presentations of those algebras wasn't neccessary. (This
   was pointed out by R. Rouquier.)

1. (with David J. Benson) *Schur--Weyl duality over finite fields.*
   Arch.  Math. 93, 425--435 (2009).

   The proof of Lemma 4.1 has a minor mistake, but the result is
   correct. See the proof of Lemma 3.2 in [T. Cruz, Commun. in Algebra
   47 (2019)] for a correct argument.


1. (with Richard Dipper) *The rational Schur algebra.*
   Represent. Theory. 12, 58--83 (2008).

   There are several mistakes in this paper. See [S. Donkin,
   J. Algebra 405 (2014)] for corrections.


1. (with Anthony Giaquinto) *Presenting Schur algebras.*
   Internat. Math. Res.  Notices. 2002, 1907 (2002).

   There is a small mistake in the statement of Theorems 2.3 and 3.3.
   The definitions of $Y_-$ in equations (2.7) and (3.9) are incorrect
   as stated. In those sets one should replace the content $\chi$ by a
   different content function $\chi'$ which is defined so that
   $\chi'(x_\alpha) = \varepsilon_{\text{min}(i,j)}$ if $\alpha =
   \varepsilon_i - \varepsilon_j$.

1. (with Karin Erdmann, Stuart Martin, and Daniel K. Nakano)
   *Representation type of Schur algebras.* Math Z. 232, 137--182 (1999).

   The Schur algebra $S(2,11)$ for $p = 2$ is tame. Theorems (A) and (B)
   in Section 1.2 should be corrected accordingly. The mistake comes
   from the first sentence in 3.5, which is incorrect. (Thanks to Qi
   Wang for pointing out the error.)
